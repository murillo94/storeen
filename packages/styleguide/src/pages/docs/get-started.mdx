## Installation

(WIP) Currently under heavy development, but will be installed soon by running either of these commands:

```
npm install @storeen/components
```

or

```
yarn add @storeen/components
```

## Usage

Make sure to wrap your app in ThemeProvider to get the default theme:

```js removePreview
import { ThemeProvider, Button } from '@storeen/components';

const App = () => (
  <ThemeProvider>
    <Button>Hi ðŸ˜€</Button>
  </ThemeProvider>
);
```
