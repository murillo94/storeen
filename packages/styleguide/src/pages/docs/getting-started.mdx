## Installing

(WIP) Currently under heavy development, but will be installed soon by running either of these commands:

```
npm install @storeen/components
```

or

```
yarn add @storeen/components
```

## Provider

Make sure to wrap your app in ThemeProvider to get the default theme:

```js removePreview
import { ThemeProvider } from '@storeen/components';

const App = () => <ThemeProvider>Hi ðŸ˜€</ThemeProvider>;
```

## Importing components

All components can be imported directly:

```js removePreview
import { Heading, Button } from '@storeen/components';
```
