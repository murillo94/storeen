## Tree shaking

If you're using modern tooling, such as webpack, create-react-app and similars, you already have tree shaking set up.

```js removePreview
import { Button, Anchor } from '@storeen/components';
```

## Separate files

(WIP) @storeen/components also exposes separate files for each module. If you can't do tree shaking, you should import files directly:

```js removePreview
import { Button } from '@storeen/components/Button';
import { Anchor } from '@storeen/components/Anchor';
```
